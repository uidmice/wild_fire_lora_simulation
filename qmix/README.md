# Abstract

The implementation of multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm in Pytorch, including: Grid-Wise Control, Qmix, Centralized PPO. Different learning strategies can be specified during training, and model and experimental data can be saved.

**Quick Start:** Run the **main.py** script to start training. Please specify all parameters in the **config.yaml** file (The parameters used in this project are not optimal parameters, please adjust them according to the actual requirement).

# Petting Zoo

**MPE:** Multi Particle Environments (MPE) are a set of communication oriented environment where particle agents can (sometimes) move, communicate, see each other, push each other around, and interact with fixed landmarks.

These environments are from [OpenAIâ€™s MPE](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs) codebase, with several minor fixes, mostly related to making the action space discrete by default, making the rewards consistent and cleaning up the observation space of certain environments.

The environment applied in this project is **Simple Spread** (I'm also considering adding other environments in future releases).
